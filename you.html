        I am Anthony Obispo. I'm 20 years old and this'll be my first ever web page I've made for myself..
        OF
        MYSELF.
        I'm on the pursuit of becoming my own comfort and reinvent my life. Although I may be reserved, I
        love
        to have social interactions, making/seeing people laugh, smile, and fully engage in a conversation
        feels
        great.
        McDonalds Sprite connoisseur, it's something about their Sprite where I know they be charging it
        overnight in some batteries. Having mental block situations I have come up with (coping) mechanisms,
        my
        coping mechanisms are weight-lifting and biking; in a creative aspect I paint, draw and sketch. I
        also
        got a mans' based in Jurupa Valley, California. ;)

        Why not try it all, if you only remember it once?

    <h2> Hobbies</h2>
    <ul style="color:white">
        <li>Right Side Hitter, Volleyball</li>
        <li>Creative, painting and drawing</li>
        <li>Cityscaping</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color: white;"> I started volleyball in <u>highschool</u>, I will admit I was <i>pretty bad</i> at first but as I stuck
        with the training and getting comfortable with my team - I excelled.
        Being a creative being, I've always liked illustrating what comes visually in my mind or using reference photos
        and merging ideas - I'd usually do this when I'm out of my room, out in the city of <b>Chicago</b> willingly
        getting lost until I find a spot where I can work.
